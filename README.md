# Discord-Reaction-Role-Bot
Code for a Discord Rewrite Bot which can assign roles based on the users reaction. 

For the bot to work:
  1. The reaction emoticon and the role should be named the same thing
  2. The bot should have the proper permissions
  3. The message that has to be reacted to has to be typed out manually and its message ID should be copy pasted into the code.
  4. The token ID can be obtained from the Discord Developer Portal > Applications > Bot > Copy
