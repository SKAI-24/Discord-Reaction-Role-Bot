# Discord-Reaction-Role-Bot
Code for a Discord Rewrite Bot which can assign roles based on the users reaction. 

For the bot to work:
  1. The reaction emoticon and the role should be named the same thing
  2. The bot should have the proper permissions
  3. The admin/programmer has to type the message out which has to be reacted to and its ID should be pasted in the proper place.
  4. The token ID can be obtained from the Discord Developer Portal > Applications > Bot > Copy
